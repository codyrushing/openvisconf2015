# Scrolling

Not talking about silly parallax bullshit.

Good example is distance metric data vis projects (traversing the solar system through scroll).

Triggering some interaction when a user scrolls to a particular element.

Scroll interaction (eg. Color Meaning, Clubs that Connect, Battle at the Berrics, Bloomberg Auto Sales)

Continuous transitions on scroll (scaling something, drawing some line as the user scrolls)

Mobile Vis - good repo of mobile data vis.

Scroll on mobile is suboptimal (although there are libraries to help).  Seeing more swipe.
