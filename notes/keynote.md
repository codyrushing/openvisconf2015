* Graphics APIs (Processing, OpenGL), powerful but difficult to use
* Chart typologies (google charts, excel). easy but limited.
* Finding a new middle - declarative languages

# D3 and protovis are those new middle pieces.  Less emphasis on code mechanics, more declarative.
* More platform agnostic.
* more reusable and scaleable

# Vega
* Higher level abstraction on top of D3

More and more user-friendly abstractions are being built up.

But how to make interactions better?  Treat user interaction data as first class streaming data, so it gets built in directly into the core logic of the program.
* Borrowed approach from functional reactive programming (React js).  

But, debugging as you go more abstract gets more and more difficult
