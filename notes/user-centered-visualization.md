# User-Centered Visualization Research
Lane Harrison

So many design choices (bar chart, scatterplots, stacked charts, etc) - which is correct?
* A-B user testing.  Come up with your design models, and test them
* Models must be grounded in some sort of theory.

## Weber's Law
* deltaP = k * deltaI/I
* I : Intensity of stimulus.
* deltaI : change in intensity
* Model for level level perecptual discrimination
* Basically, it's linear as change in intensity (variation) increases.

Turns out, all different models obey Weber's Law
