Expression and utility - where they muddle and crossover.  Through software.

Exciting time to be a creator, with software being so available and powerful.  Wild west.

Went to UCLA Digital Media Arts school.  Was exposed to Processing there.

Got involved with Gray Area in SF.

Made Patatap.  Lots of stuff happened with that.
