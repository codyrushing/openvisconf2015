# Loops

Looped graphics have been around a lot time.

Small multiples repeat in space.  Loops repeat in time.

## Why are loops effective
* Exposure effect - you start to develop an affinity for stuff you are repeatedly exposed to
* Expectation - your brain starts anticipating what comes next.  When it happens and it's right, you get some level of satisfaction from that.
* Shifting attention - on each cycle, you examine a different portion of the song or image.  It helps us notice differences and patterns over time.
* Transformation - something ordinary becomes something else.  If you repeatedly hear a certain voice, for example, it may begin to sound like singing or music or melody.  It actually works.
