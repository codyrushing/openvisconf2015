# Power of the Reveal
Hannah Fairfield - NYT - visual journalist

Visual storytelling.  You will come up with crazy idea for how to visualize data - just test them.  They might work.

Reveals can be dramatic and powerful in a storytelling context.

## Layering information
* eg. putting smaller small multiples data underneath larger integrated visualization.

## Mobile
* Much more difficult with limited space (see "Russia's Endgame in Ukraine")

## Don't be afaid to be goofy
* Games, but those that inform (NYC navigation quiz)
